      IMPORTANT UPDATE: We are in need of 2 new captains. Everyone should of recently been contacted asking their thoughts on going to 6 teams. The overwhelming response was to go ahead to make the switch. The late winter must be making us nutty so we are going to scrap the draft we just did, bring on 2 new captains, redraft and try to make 6 teams work this Spring! Just understand we could potentially have field issues but we will work through them.
    </p>
    <p>
    Speaking of the field, we're not ready to cancel this week, keeping an eye on the field condition and weather, if the field is good for this Sunday it will now be a draft game with the 6 captains drafting after. So as of right now we need 2 new Captains, please this is time sensitive, only serious inquires, if you are interested please get a hold of Mark, either by message or email (<a href="mailto:rebuckmark@gmail.com">rebuckmark@gmail.com</a>). Thanks everyone for bearing with us and supporting the league.
    </p>

      Same as the Fall, we will continue to play at Camp Security park, corner of Eastern Boulevard and Locust Grove Rd (map below or link <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/qfLZB">here</a>).
      Also same as Fall each team will play 2 games to 15 with hour and a half time caps.
